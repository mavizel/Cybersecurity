# Cybersecurity
OSI Model: 7 Layers (Physical to Application).
# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Journey

## 🌐 Networking Fundamentals: The OSI Model
*I am documenting my understanding of the 7 layers as I prepare for university.*

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
* **Concept:** The "hardware" layer. 
* **My Notes:** This layer is all about wires, cables, and signals. It handles the physical transmission of data bits.

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
* **Concept:** Local addressing and framing.
* **My Notes:** Converts bits into data frames and provides physical addressing using MAC Addresses. It also checks for errors.

### Layer 3: Network Layer
* **Concept:** Routing and IP Addresses.
* **My Notes:** Manages the mapping between physical (MAC) and logical (IP) addresses. It decides the path data takes across networks.

### Layer 4: Transport Layer
* **Concept:** Reliability and Coordination.
* **My Notes:** Coordinates speed and data flow using TCP (reliable) and UDP (fast). It breaks data into segments with port numbers.

### Layer 5: Session Layer
* **Concept:** Connection Management.
* **My Notes:** Responsible for authentication, setting up, and managing sessions between applications.

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
* **Concept:** The Translator.
* **My Notes:** Converts characters and numbers into binary that the computer understands. Also handles encryption and compression.

### Layer 7: Application Layer
* **Concept:** The User Interface.
* **My Notes:** The layer where protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, and SMTP live for the apps we use.
* 
IP Addresses: Learning the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.
MAC Address: The unique hardware ID for my devices.
